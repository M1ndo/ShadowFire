#+title: Shadowfire
* General Information
** Why this tool exists?
I got tired of configuring/do things manually as it would've taken me at least 15-20min,
so i wrote this script that will save me time and like 1-2min.
** Use cases.
- Bootable Live USB Arch based distro, can be anything but preferably
  blackarch (Currently Broken 'glibc problem')
  OR
- A normal installed Arch based distro
  OR
- Setup a remote arch based distro to be used as a proxy ( still needs some tweaking )
** What this tool does?
It will automatically setup *dnscrypt* with [[https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy][dnscrypt-proxy]] and use it.
It will automatically setup *tor* with/without bridges and enable a socks5 proxy.
It will automatically change timezone and change mac address.
It will automatically setup iptables with ufw rules.
This tool can also forces DNS traffic via tcp to be used with tor socks proxy.
** What this tool doesn't do!
This tool will not route your whole traffic to tor via a transparent proxy (WHY?).
I don't want to route my whole traffic, which can be bad/annoying for certain reasons.
And meanly i still want some stuff to go out without tor.
You want full *anonymization* use *TOR-BROWSER*
** When not to use this tool.
Don't use this tool if you have no upper understanding of what it does ( But you can trust it ).
Don't use this tool without knowing what configurations this tool does ( But you can trust it ).
** Tips
*DNSCRYPT-proxy* will use anon relays to pass dns queries to selected nameservers.
When forcing DNS traffic via TCP it will use tor as proxy to route the traffic because tor doesn't support udp neither any proxy! (a more obfuscated way).
When Iptables are set with UFW it will only allow input//output in port 9110 by default, you could change/add any ports in config file.
PLEASE before start using tor proxy and do stupid shit mixing vpn's and proxies PLEASE referre to [[https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN][TorPlusX]] unless you wanna go to jail.
AND inspect your traffic :).
